                        	<h3>Taplow Community.</h3>
                            <p>Taplow is a beautiful Parish that stretches all the way from Odds Farm to Marsh Lane, on the way to Dorney.
                            Having lived here for over a decade, I've noticed that the areas outside the village often get forgotten or are
                            ignored. A good and effective Parish Council should stay connected to all it's residents and not just focus on
                             the concerns of the few. I would really value the opportunity to work on your behalf to ensure that happens.</p>
                            <p>We stand at the gateway of a new era, with Crossrail beckoning and two significant housing developments
                            on the way. If we are to preserve the beautiful nature of the Parish we must come together to listen to residents
                            and protect the needs of the community as a whole.</p>

                        	<h3>Taplow Families.</h3>
                            <p>I have lived in the Parish for 11 years along with my wife, Zoe & two children, Dallas and Billy. Did you know that 
                            nearly half of residents in Taplow are under the age of 45? It’s not quite the sleepy parish it appears! I was surprised 
                            to learn that only 2 out of 10 councillors presently fall into that demographic. Many people have told me they don’t 
                            have a voice and it’s easy to see why they feel that way. I’m delighted that both candidates in this election are 
                            family people, it’s a win for the residents of Taplow to get more widespread representation.</p>

                            <p>In my day job, I work in central government, a Chief Technical Officer by trade I am currently employed 
                            as a Senior Civil Servant. In my role I am leading an internationally renowned project that manages change, 
                            embracing the best of new ideas, ensuring a quality service for users and getting best value for the people 
                            of Britain. I also sit on the board of a number of young companies as a non-executive director, advising on 
                            investment and supporting them in growth.</p>
                            <p>I hope you’ll agree, my professional skills could be a real asset to the needs of our Parish, especially 
                            at this time of flux. I would really value the opportunity to help manage the challenges our Parish is 
                            facing and contribute to the decisions that lie ahead. </p>
